  ## Description
  Employee Tracker is a command line application that allows a user to easily interact with a company's employee database. It uses inquirer's prompt functionality to package the power of MySql's database and query functionality. The user can view all Departments, Roles, and Employees listed within this database, and add and update this data if required.  
  ## Instructions
  Clone down the repo, navigate to the proper directory, install all necessary dependencies, and then initialize the app by entering npm start into the command line. 
  ## Usage
  User must have MySql installed and create an employeetracker database to connect with. This name of course can be changed at the desire of user but make sure to update the connection in the config folder of the repo! 
 Here is a walkthrough video demonstrating the current functionality of the app:
